What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* Distinguishing which branch to git push and git pull from, how to resolve a merge conflict.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* General rule of thumb we agreed upon was thaat git push to Github would usually be from the feature-branch by default and git pull origin would be from the master branch. We also went over merge conflicts.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* 
- Can you do a git pull on only a portion of the files from your Github repo?
- What is the difference between a git reset and git revert?
- What are the immediate concerns with pushing up to Gthub from the local master repo?

What still confuses you about Git?

* Not much, I believe I have a good feel on the Git concepts we've learned so far.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* Very positive. My pair was very patient and friendly. We both helped each other out several times in the steps as well as answering each others' questions. My Guide, Matthew, also took a lot of time answering our questions in great detail which I appreciated.
