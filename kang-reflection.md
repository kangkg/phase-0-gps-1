#My reflection on GPS 1.1

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
      One of the concepts I struggled with was with cloning the repo originally. However, it was a simple error and I came to understand what I did!
* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
      I was able to thoroughly clear up any questions I had with Git, and feel rather familiar with it now. 
* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
      I asked both my pair and guide questions on Git Workflow and ensuring that we were always on the same page. I was rather confused about git fetch, but came to understand its use. 
* **What still confuses you about Git?**
      I am curious on how Git works internally (all I see is what happens externally of Git), and if it's possible to fork only part of a repository (I think this may be far too advanced for me though at the moment.)
* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
      It was a really good experience, working with a pair, and being able to ask questions freely to my guiding mentor was a really great.
